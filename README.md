<b> Scrumdinger </b>

Scrumdinger is an app built alongside an Apple Developer SwiftUI tutorial. It provides users the ability to document daily scrums, add and edit teams, and transcribe meetings. It is written entirely in SwiftUI and makes use of AVFoundation, Speech Recognition, Core Data, iOS version-dependent styles, and multi-threading.
